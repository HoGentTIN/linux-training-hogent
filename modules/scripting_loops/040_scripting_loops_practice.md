## practice: scripting tests and loops

1. Write a script that uses a `for` loop to count from 3 to 7.

2. Write a script that uses a `for` loop to count from 1 to 17000.

3. Write a script that uses a `while` loop to count from 3 to 7.

4. Write a script that uses an `until` loop to count down from 8 to 4.

5. Write a script that uses a for loop to count the number of files ending in `.txt` in the current directory and displays a message "There are N files ending in .txt".

6. Improve the script with conditional statements so the displayed message is also correct when there are zero files or one file ending in `.txt`.
