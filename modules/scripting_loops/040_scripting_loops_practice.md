## practice: scripting tests and loops

1. Write a script that uses a `for` loop to count from 3 to 7.

2. Write a script that uses a `for` loop to count from 1 to 17000.

3. Write a script that uses a `while` loop to count from 3 to 7.

4. Write a script that uses an `until` loop to count down from 8 to 4.

5. Write a script that counts the number of files ending in `.txt` in
the current directory.

6. Wrap an `if` statement around the script so it is also correct when
there are zero files ending in `.txt`.
