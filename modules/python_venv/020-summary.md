In the module about package management, we discussed package management for Python with `pip` and how it can create conflicts with system packages. In this module, we will expand on this subject by enumerating some best practices in the current landscape and by exploring how to use Python virtual environments to manage dependencies for a specific project.

Learning goals:

- Set up a Python virtual environment and understand how it works.
- Install and manage Python packages within a virtual environment.
- Make a virtual environment reproducible using a requirements file.
- Deploy a Python workload using a virtual environment in Docker.
