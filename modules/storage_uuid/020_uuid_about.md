A **uuid** or *universally unique identifier* is used to uniquely identify objects. This 128bit standard allows anyone to create a unique *uuid*. That is, the number of *uuid's* that can be generated is so large that the probability of generating a duplicate is extremely low.

This chapter takes a brief look at *uuid*'s, specifically in the context of identifying partitions and filesystems.
