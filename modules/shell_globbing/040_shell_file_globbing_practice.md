## practice: shell globbing

1\. Create a test directory and enter it.

2\. Create the following files :

    file1
    file10
    file11
    file2
    File2
    File3
    file33
    fileAB
    filea
    fileA
    fileAAA
    file(
    file 2

(the last one has 6 characters including a space)

3\. List (with ls) all files starting with file

4\. List (with ls) all files starting with File

5\. List (with ls) all files starting with file and ending in a number.

6\. List (with ls) all files starting with file and ending with a letter

7\. List (with ls) all files starting with File and having a digit as
fifth character.

8\. List (with ls) all files starting with File and having a digit as
fifth character and nothing else.

9\. List (with ls) all files starting with a letter and ending in a
number.

10\. List (with ls) all files that have exactly five characters.

11\. List (with ls) all files that start with f or F and end with 3 or
A.

12\. List (with ls) all files that start with f have i or R as second
character and end in a number.

13\. List all files that do not start with the letter F.

14\. Copy the value of \$LANG to \$MyLANG.

15\. Show the influence of \$LANG in listing A-Z or a-z ranges.

16\. You receive information that one of your servers was cracked, the
cracker probably replaced the `ls` command. You know that the `echo`
command is safe to use. Can `echo` replace `ls` ? How can you list the
files in the current directory with `echo` ?

17\. Is there another command besides cd to change directories ?
