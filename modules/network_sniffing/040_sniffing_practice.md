## practice: network sniffing

1\. Install wireshark on your computer (not inside a virtual machine).

2\. Start a ping between your computer and another computer.

3\. Start sniffing the network.

4\. Display only the ping echo\'s in the top pane using a filter.

5\. Now ping to a name (like www.linux-training.be) and try to sniff the
DNS query and response. Which DNS server was used ? Was it a tcp or udp
query and response ?

6\. Find an amateur/hobby/club website that features a login prompt.
Attempt to login with user \'paul\' and password \'hunter2\' while your
sniffer is running. Now find this information in the sniffer.
