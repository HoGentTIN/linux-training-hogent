## solution: commands and arguments

1\. How many `arguments` are in this line (not counting the command
itself).

    touch '/etc/cron/cron.allow' 'file 42.txt' "file 33.txt"

    answer: three

2\. Is `tac` a shell builtin command ?

    type tac

3\. Is there an existing alias for `rm` ?

    alias rm

4\. Read the man page of `rm`, make sure you understand the `-i` option
of rm. Create and remove a file to test the `-i` option.

    man rm

    touch testfile

    rm -i testfile

5\. Execute: `alias rm='rm -i'` . Test your alias with a test file. Does
this work as expected ?

    touch testfile

    rm testfile (should ask for confirmation)

6\. List all current aliases.

    alias

7a. Create an alias called \'city\' that echoes your hometown.

    alias city='echo Antwerp'

7b. Use your alias to test that it works.

    city (it should display Antwerp)

8\. Execute `set -x` to display shell expansion for every command.

    set -x

9\. Test the functionality of `set -x` by executing your `city` and `rm`
aliases.

    shell should display the resolved aliases and then execute the command:
    student@linux:~$ set -x
    student@linux:~$ city
    + echo antwerp
    antwerp

10 Execute `set +x` to stop displaying shell expansion.

    set +x

11\. Remove your city alias.

    unalias city

12\. What is the location of the `cat` and the `passwd` commands ?

    which cat (probably /bin/cat)

    which passwd (probably /usr/bin/passwd)

13\. Explain the difference between the following commands:

    echo

    /bin/echo

The `echo` command will be interpreted by the shell as the
`built-in echo` command. The `/bin/echo` command will make the shell
execute the `echo binary` located in the `/bin` directory.

14\. Explain the difference between the following commands:

    echo Hello

    echo -n Hello

The -n option of the `echo` command will prevent echo from echoing a
trailing newline. `echo Hello` will echo six characters in total,
`echo -n hello` only echoes five characters.

(The -n option might not work in the Korn shell.)

15\. Display `A B C` with two spaces between B and C.

    echo "A B  C"

16\. Complete the following command (do not use spaces) to display
exactly the following output:

    4+4     =8
    10+14   =24

The solution is to use tabs with \\t.

    echo -e "4+4\t=8" ; echo -e "10+14\t=24"

17\. Use `echo` to display the following exactly:

    ??\\
    echo '??\\'
    echo -e '??\\\\'
    echo "??\\\\"
    echo -e "??\\\\\\"
    echo ??\\\\

Find two solutions with single quotes, two with double quotes and one
without quotes (and say thank you to Ren√© and Darioush from Google for
this extra).

18\. Use one `echo` command to display three words on three lines.

    echo -e "one \ntwo \nthree"
