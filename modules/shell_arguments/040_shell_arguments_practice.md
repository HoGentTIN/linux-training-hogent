## practice: commands and arguments

1. How many `arguments` are in this line (not counting the command itself).

    ```
    touch '/etc/cron/cron.allow' 'file 42.txt' "file 33.txt"
    ```

2. Is `tac` a shell builtin command?

3. Is there an existing alias for `rm`?

4. Read the man page of `rm`, make sure you understand the `-i` option of `rm`. Create and remove a file to test the `-i` option.

5. Execute: `alias rm='rm -i'` . Test your alias with a test file. Does this work as expected?

6. List all current aliases.

7. Create an alias called 'city' that echoes your hometown.

    Use your alias to test that it works.

8. Execute `set -x` to display shell expansion for every command.

9. Test the functionality of `set -x` by executing your `city` and `rm` aliases.

10. Execute `set +x` to stop displaying shell expansion.

11. Remove your city alias.

12. What is the location of the `cat` and the `passwd` commands?

13. Explain the difference between the following commands:

    ```
    echo

    /bin/echo
    ```

14. Explain the difference between the following commands:

    ```
    echo Hello

    echo -n Hello
    ```

15. Display `A B C` with two spaces between B and C.

16. *(optional) Complete the following command (do not use spaces) to display exactly the following output:

    ```
    4+4     =8
    10+14   =24
    ```

17. Use `echo` to display the following exactly:

    ```
    ??\\
    ```

    Find two solutions with single quotes, two with double quotes and one without quotes (and say thank you to Ren√© and Darioush from Google for this extra).

18. Use one `echo` command to display three words on three lines.
