Commands that are created to be used with a `pipe` are often called
`filters`. These `filters` are very small programs that do
one specific thing very efficiently. They can be used as
`building blocks`.

This chapter will introduce you to the most common `filters`. The
combination of simple commands and filters in a long `pipe` allows you
to design elegant solutions.
