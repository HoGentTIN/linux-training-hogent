## practice: filters

1. Put a sorted list of all bash users in bashusers.txt.

2. Put a sorted list of all logged on users in onlineusers.txt.

3. Make a list of all filenames in `/etc` that contain the string `conf` in their filename.

4. Make a sorted list of all files in `/etc` that contain the case insensitive string `conf` in their filename.

5. Look at the output of `ip neigh` (ARP cache, listing other hosts on the same local network) and filter out the MAC addresses.

6. Write a line that removes all non-letters from a stream.

7. Write a line that receives a text file, and outputs all words on a separate line.

8. Write a spell checker on the command line, i.e. list all words in a file that do not occur in a dictionary. There will probably be a dictionary in `/usr/share/dict/`.
