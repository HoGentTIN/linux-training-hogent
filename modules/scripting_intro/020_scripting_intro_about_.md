A scripting or script language is a `programming language` for a special
run-time environment/shells that automates the execution of commands
one-by-one or line-by-line by a its user. Scripting languages are often
interpreted, rather than compiled.

Shells like `sh`, `ksh` and `bash` have support for programming
constructs that can be saved as`scripts`. These `scripts` can be
converted into `shell` commands. Many UNIX/Linux commands are
essentially `scripts` that were placed in various `/bin``/usr/bin`,
`/usr/sbin` or `/sbin`. Some of these `scripts` can be inserted as
`User profile scripts` that run when a user logins or can become to be
`init scripts`, which are run when a `daemon` is started or stopped.
Subsequently, This means that system administrators or SysOps also need
solid knowledge of `scripting` to understand how their servers and their
applications are started, updated, upgraded, patched, maintained,
configured and removed, and also to understand how a user environment is
built.

The goal of this chapter is to give you all the information in order to
read, write and understand small, long and complex scripts.
