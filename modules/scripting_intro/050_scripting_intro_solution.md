## solution: introduction to scripting

1. Write a Python Hello World script, give it a shebang and make it executable.

    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/python3
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```

    ```console
    $ chmod +x hello.py
    $ ./hello.py
    Hello, World!
    ```

2. What would happen if you remove the shebang and try to execute the script again?

    The script will be executed by the default interpreter, in this case, the Bash shell, which will not understand the Python syntax.

    ```console
    $ ./hello.py
    ./hello.py: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `"Hello world!"'
    ./hello.py: line 1: `print("Hello world!")'
    ```

3. Create a Bash script `greeting.sh` that says hello to the user (make use of the shell variable with the current user's login name), prints the current date and time, and prints a quote. Ensure that you apply the shell settings to make your script easier to debug.

    ```bash
    #! /bin/bash --

    set -o nounset
    set -o errexit
    set -o pipefail

    echo "Hello ${USER}, today is:"
    date
    echo "Quote of the day:"
    fortune | cowsay
    ```

4. Copy the script to `/usr/local/bin` without the extension and verify that you can run it from any directory as a command.

    ```console
    student@linux:~$ sudo cp greeting.sh /usr/local/bin/greeting
    student@linux:~$ greeting
    Hello student, today is:
    Wed Mar  6 09:17:00 PM UTC 2024
    Quote of the day:

     --------------------------------------
            \   ^__^
             \  (oo)\_______
                (__)\       )\/\
                    ||----w |
                    ||     ||
    student@linux:~$ cd /tmp
    student@linux:/tmp$ greeting
    Hello student, today is:
    Wed Mar  6 09:17:08 PM UTC 2024
    Quote of the day:
     _________________________________

     ---------------------------------
            \   ^__^
             \  (oo)\_______
                (__)\       )\/\
                    ||----w |
                    ||     ||
    ```

5. Take another look at the script `hello-var.sh` where we printed a variable that was not assigned. What happens if you assign the value `Tux` to the variable `user` on the interactive shell and then run the script? What do we have to do to make sure the variable is available in the script?

    ```console
    student@linux:~$ ./hello-var.sh 
    Hello 
    student@linux:~$ user=Tux
    student@linux:~$ ./hello-var.sh 
    Hello
    student@linux:~$ export user
    student@linux:~$ ./hello-var.sh 
    Hello Tux
    ```

6. What if we change the value of the variable `user` in the script? Will this change affect the value of the variable in the interactive shell after the script is finished?

    We change the script to:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # hello-var.sh -- example of variable assignment
    user="Linus"

    echo "Hello ${user}"
    ```

    And execute it:

    ```console
    student@linux:~$ export user=Tux
    student@linux:~$ echo $user
    Tux
    student@linux:~$ ./hello-var.sh 
    Hello Linus
    student@linux:~$ echo $user
    Tux
    ```

    The change in the script does not affect the value of the variable in the interactive shell after the script is finished!
