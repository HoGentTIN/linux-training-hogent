This chapter has three distinct subjects.

First we look at login logging ; how can we find out who is logging in
to the system, when and from where. And who is not logging in, who fails
at `su` or `ssh`.

Second we discuss how to configure the syslog daemon, and how to test it
with `logger`.

The last part is mostly about `rotating logs` and mentions the `tail -f`
and `watch` commands for `watching logs`.
