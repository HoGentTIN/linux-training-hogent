The `vi` editor is installed on almost every Unix. Linux
will very often install `vim` (`vi improved`) which is
similar. Every system administrator should know `vi(m)`, because it is
an easy tool to solve problems.

The `vi` editor is not intuitive, but once you get to know it, `vi`
becomes a very powerful application. Most Linux distributions will
include the `vimtutor` which is a 45 minute lesson in
`vi(m)`.
