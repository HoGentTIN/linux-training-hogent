This chapter will tell you how to manage RAM memory and cache.

We start with some simple tools to display information about memory:
`free -om`, `top` and
`cat /proc/meminfo`.

We continue with managing swap space, using terms like
`swapping`, `paging` and
`virtual memory`.

The last part is about using `vmstat` to monitor swap usage.
