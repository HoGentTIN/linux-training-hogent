## practice: file systems

1\. List the filesystems that are known by your system.

2\. Create an `ext2` filesystem on the 200MB partition.

3\. Create an `ext3` filesystem on one of the 300MB logical drives.

4\. Create an `ext4` on the 400MB partition.

5\. Set the reserved space for root on the ext3 filesystem to 0 percent.

6\. Verify your work with `fdisk` and `df`.

7\. Perform a file system check on all the new file systems.
