# practice: binding and bonding

1\. Add an extra `ip address` to one of your network cards. Test that it
works (have your neighbour ssh to it)!

2\. Use `ifdown` to disable this extra `ip address`.

3\. Make sure your neighbour also succeeded in `binding` an extra ip
address before you continue.

4\. Add an extra network card (or two) to your virtual machine and use
the theory to `bond` two network cards.
