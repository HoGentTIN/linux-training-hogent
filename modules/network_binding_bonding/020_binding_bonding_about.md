Sometimes a server needs more than one `ip address` on the same network
card, we call this `binding` ip addresses.

Linux can also activate multiple network cards behind the same
`ip address`, this is called `bonding`.

This chapter will teach you how to configure `binding` and `bonding` on
the most common Linux distributions.
