## practice: control operators

0. Each question can be answered by one command line!

1. When you type `passwd`, which file is executed ?

2. What kind of file is that ?

3. Execute the `pwd` command twice. (remember 0.)

4. Execute `ls` after `cd /etc`, but only if `cd /etc` did not error.

5. Execute `cd /etc` after `cd etc`, but only if `cd etc` fails.

6. Echo `it worked` when `touch test42` works, and echo `it failed`
when the `touch` failed. All on one command line as a normal user (not
root). Test this line in your home directory and in `/bin/` .

7. Execute `sleep 6`, what is this command doing ?

8. Execute `sleep 200` in background (do not wait for it to finish).
