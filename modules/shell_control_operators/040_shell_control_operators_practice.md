## practice: control operators

0\. Each question can be answered by one command line!

1\. When you type `passwd`, which file is executed ?

2\. What kind of file is that ?

3\. Execute the `pwd` command twice. (remember 0.)

4\. Execute `ls` after `cd /etc`, but only if `cd /etc` did not error.

5\. Execute `cd /etc` after `cd etc`, but only if `cd etc` fails.

6\. Echo `it worked` when `touch test42` works, and echo `it failed`
when the `touch` failed. All on one command line as a normal user (not
root). Test this line in your home directory and in `/bin/` .

7\. Execute `sleep 6`, what is this command doing ?

8\. Execute `sleep 200` in background (do not wait for it to finish).

9\. Write a command line that executes `rm file55`. Your command line
should print \'success\' if file55 is removed, and print \'failed\' if
there was a problem.

(optional)10. Use echo to display \"Hello World with strange\'
characters \\ \* \[ } \~ \\\\ .\" (including all quotes)
