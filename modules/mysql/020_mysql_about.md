`mysql` is a database server that understands Structured
Query Language (`SQL`). MySQL was developed by the Swedish
Company `MySQL AB`. The first release was in 1995. In 2008 MySQL AB was
bought by Sun Microsystems (which is now owned by Oracle).

`mysql` is very popular for websites in combination with
`php` and `apache` (the `m` in `lamp`
servers), but `mysql` is also used in organizations with huge databases
like Facebook, Flickr, Google, Nokia, Wikipedia and Youtube.

This chapter will teach you `sql` by creating and using small databases,
tables, queries and a simple trigger in a local `mysql` server.
