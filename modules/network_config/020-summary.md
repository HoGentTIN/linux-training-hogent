This chapter explains how to configure network interfaces on a Linux system. There are considerable differences between distributions, even within the same family. Some distribution even support several methods to configure network interfaces.

We will discuss the most common tools and configuration files of the Debian, and Enterprise Linux families.

If you want to know more about the subject, we recommend to look up the documentation that is specific to your distribution. When you Google, chances are that the information that you find is out of date not relevant for your specific situation.
