In this chapter, we learn how to setup an Apache web server.

The origins of Apache can be traced back to 1995, when the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) released the first version of the *NCSA httpd web server*. Being open source, people started to contribute improvements and changes to the code, also called *patches*. That's what lead to the name: *a patchy* web server, or Apache.

Apache is a key component of the LAMP stack, consisting of Linux, Apache, Mysql, and Perl/PHP/Python. The LAMP stack is a widely used platform for web development and lies at the base of the web 2.0 revolution.

Between about 1996 and 2016, Apache was market leader in web servers. In its peak period around 2005, about 70% of all web servers were running on Apache (see <https://www.netcraft.com/blog/june-2024-web-server-survey/>).

Nowadays, Apache shares the leading market position with the Nginx web server, but it is still widely used and supported.
