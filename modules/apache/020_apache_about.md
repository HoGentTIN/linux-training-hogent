In this chapter we learn how to setup a web server with the `apache`
software.

According to NetCraft
(http://news.netcraft.com/archives/web_server_survey.html) about seventy
percent of all web servers are running on Apache. The name is derived
from `a patchy` web server, because of all the patches people wrote for
the NCSA httpd server.

Later chapters will expand this web server into a LAMP stack (Linux,
Apache, Mysql, Perl/PHP/Python).
