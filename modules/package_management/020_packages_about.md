Most Linux distributions have a **package management** system with online **repositories** containing thousands of packages. This makes it very easy to install, update  and remove applications, operating system components, documentation and much more.

In this module, we introduce some basic terminology and concepts. Details about managing packages on the major distributions, specifically the Debian and Enterprise Linux families, are covered in separate modules. In this module, we also discuss a two additional types of package management tools that are not distribution-specific.

- Some programming languages have their own package managers (e.g. `pip` for Python).
- In the 2010s, containerization became popular and started to be used as a solution for package management independent of the Linux distribution, e.g. `snap` and `flatpak`.

Finally, we show how you can install software outside of the package management system, starting from the source code.
