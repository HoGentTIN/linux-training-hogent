Most Linux distributions have a **package management** system with online **repositories** containing thousands of packages. This makes it very easy to install and remove applications, operating system components, documentation and much more.

We first discuss the Debian package format `.deb` and its tools `dpkg`, `apt-get` and `apt`. This should be similar on Debian, Ubuntu, Mint and all derived distributions.

Then we look at the Red Hat package format `.rpm` and its tools `rpm` and `dnf`. This should be similar on Red Hat, Fedora, AlmaLinux and all derived distributions.
