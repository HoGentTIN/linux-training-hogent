## practice: package management

1. Look up where your Linux distribution has published their package repositories. What is the URL? Can you find and download individual packages from there?

2. Open the graphical package manager tool on your system. What kind of software is available? Can you find the software you need? Or games that you would like to play?

3. Why would it be a bad idea to install Python packages with `pip` as root? When would you install a package (e.g. `pandas`) with `pip` instead of the package mnanager (e.g. `python3-pandas`)?

4. Check whether Snap or Flatpak is installed or available on your system. How can you search online for applications in these repositories?
