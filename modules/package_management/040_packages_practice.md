## practice: package management

1. Verify whether gcc, sudo and zork are installed.

2. Use dnf or apt to search for and install the `scp`, `tmux`, and `man`-pages packages. Did you find them all?

3. Search the internet for \'webmin\' and figure out how to install it.

4. If time permits, search for and install samba including the samba
docs pdf files (thousands of pages in two pdf\'s).
