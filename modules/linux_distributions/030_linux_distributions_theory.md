## Red Hat

Red Hat is a billion dollar commercial Linux company that puts a lot of
effort in developing Linux. They have hundreds of Linux specialists and
are known for their excellent support. They give their products (Red Hat
Enterprise Linux and Fedora) away for free. While
`Red Hat Enterprise Linux` (RHEL) is well tested before
release and supported for up to seven years after release,
`Fedora` is a distro with faster updates but without
support.

## Ubuntu

Canonical started sending out free compact discs with
`Ubuntu` Linux in 2004 and quickly became popular for home
users (many switching from Microsoft Windows). Canonical wants Ubuntu to
be an easy to use graphical Linux desktop without need to ever see a
command line. Of course they also want to make a profit by selling
support for Ubuntu.

## Debian

There is no company behind `Debian`. Instead there are
thousands of well organised developers that elect a
`Debian Project Leader` every two years. Debian is seen as one of the
most stable Linux distributions. It is also the basis of every release
of Ubuntu. Debian comes in three versions: stable, testing and unstable.
Every Debian release is named after a character in the movie Toy Story.

## Other

Distributions like CentOS, Oracle Enterprise
Linux and Scientific Linux are
based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and share many of the same principles,
directories and system administration techniques.
`Linux Mint`, Edubuntu and many other
\*buntu named distributions are based on Ubuntu and thus share a lot
with Debian. There are hundreds of other Linux distributions.

## Which to choose ?

Below are some very personal opinions on some of the most popular Linux
Distributions. Keep in mind that any of the below Linux distributions
can be a stable server and a nice graphical desktop client.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   distribution name   reason(s) for using
  -------------------- --------------------------------------------------
   Red Hat Enterprise  You are a manager and you want a good support
         (RHEL)        contract.

         CentOS        You want Red Hat without the support contract from
                       Red Hat.

         Fedora        You want Red Hat on your laptop/desktop.

       Linux Mint      You want a personal graphical desktop to play
                       movies, music and games.

         Debian        My personal favorite for servers, laptops, and any
                       other device.

         Ubuntu        Very popular, based on Debian, not my favorite.

          Kali         You want a pointy-clicky hacking interface.

         others        Advanced users may prefer Arch, Gentoo, OpenSUSE,
                       Scientific, \...

  : choosing a Linux distro

When you are new to Linux in 2015, go for the latest Mint or Fedora. If
you only want to practice the Linux command line then install one Debian
server and/or one CentOS server (without graphical interface).
