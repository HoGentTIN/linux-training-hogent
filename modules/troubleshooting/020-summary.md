In this chapter, we discuss how you can troubleshoot issues while setting up network services on a Linux system. We assume that you have a basic understanding of networking concepts, that you are familiar with the Linux command line and that you are using a fairly recent Linux distribution (with `systemd`).

Learning goals:

- Applying a systematic and thorough approach to troubleshooting, using a bottom-up strategy.
- Address issues on the network acces layer: check adapter configuration and connectivity
- Address issues on the Internet layer: local network configuration, routing within the LAN
- Address issues on the transport layer: service status, used sockets and firewall settings
- Address issues on the application layer: checking log files, validate config file syntax
