Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (or short `dhcp`) is a standard
tcp/ip protocol that distributes ip configurations to clients. `dhcp` is defined in `rfc 2131`. Before that it was defined as an update to `bootp` in rfc 1531/1541.

The alternative to `dhcp` is manually entering the ip configuration on each client computer, which becomes infeasible when you have more than a few hosts on the *lan*.
