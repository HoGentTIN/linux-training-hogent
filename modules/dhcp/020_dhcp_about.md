Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (or short `dhcp`) is a standard
tcp/ip protocol that distributes ip configurations to clients. `dhcp` is
defined in `rfc 2131` (before that it was defined as an update to
`bootp` in rfc 1531/1541.

The alternative to `dhcp` is manually entering the ip configuration on
each client computer.
