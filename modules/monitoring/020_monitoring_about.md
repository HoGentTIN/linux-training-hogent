Monitoring is the process of obtaining information about the utilization
of memory, cpu, bandwidth and storage. You should start monitoring your
system as soon as possible, to be able to create a `baseline`. Make sure
that you get to know your system! This baseline is important because it
allows you to see a steady or sudden growth in `resource utilization`
and likewise steady (or sudden) decline in `resource availability`. It
will allow you to plan for scaling up or scaling out.

`df -h`, `free -om` and
`du -sh`.
