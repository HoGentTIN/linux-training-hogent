# hardware or software

Redundant Array of Independent (originally Inexpensive) Disks or
`RAID` can be set up using hardware or software. Hardware
RAID is more expensive, but offers better performance. Software RAID is
cheaper and easier to manage, but it uses your CPU and your memory.

Where ten years ago nobody was arguing about the best choice being
hardware RAID, this has changed since technologies like mdadm, lvm and
even zfs focus more on managability. The workload on the cpu for
software RAID used to be high, but cpu\'s have gotten a lot faster.
