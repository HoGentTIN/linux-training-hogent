This module is a step by step demonstration of an actual installation of
`CentOS 8`.

We start by downloading an image from the internet and install
`CentOS 8` as a virtual machine in `Virtualbox`. We will also do some
basic configuration of this new machine like setting an `ip address` and
fixing a `hostname`.

This procedure should be very similar for other versions of `CentOS`,
and also for distributions like `RHEL` (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) or
`Fedora`. This procedure can also be helpful if you are using another
virtualization solution.
