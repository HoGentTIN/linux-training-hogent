This module is a step by step demonstration of an actual installation of
`Debian 8` (also known as `Jessie`).

We start by downloading an image from the internet and install
`Debian 8` as a virtual machine in `Virtualbox`. We will also do some
basic configuration of this new machine like setting an `ip address` and
fixing a `hostname`.

This procedure should be very similar for other versions of `Debian`,
and also for distributions like `Linux Mint`, `xubuntu/ubuntu/kubuntu`
or `Mepis`. This procedure can also be helpful if you are using another
virtualization solution.

Go to the next chapter if you want to install
`CentOS, Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, ...`.
