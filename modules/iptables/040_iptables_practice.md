# practice: packet filtering

1\. Make sure you can ssh to your router-system when iptables is active.

2\. Make sure you can ping to your router-system when iptables is
active.

3\. Define one of your networks as \'internal\' and the other as
\'external\'. Configure the router to allow visits to a website (http)
to go from the internal network to the external network (but not in the
other direction).

4\. Make sure the internal network can ssh to the external, but not the
other way around.
