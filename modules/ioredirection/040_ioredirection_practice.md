## practice: input/output redirection

1\. Activate the `noclobber` shell option.

2\. Verify that `noclobber` is active by repeating an `ls` on `/etc/`
with redirected output to a file.

3\. When listing all shell options, which character represents the
`noclobber` option ?

4\. Deactivate the `noclobber` option.

5\. Make sure you have two shells open on the same computer. Create an
empty `tailing.txt` file. Then type `tail -f tailing.txt`. Use the
second shell to `append` a line of text to that file. Verify that the
first shell displays this line.

6\. Create a file that contains the names of five people. Use `cat` and
output redirection to create the file and use a `here document` to end
the input.
