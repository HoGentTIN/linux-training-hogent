In this chapter, you will learn how to acquire pre-built images for a Linux VM, import them into VirtualBox and start using them.

In order to start using Linux, it is not necessary to reformat or repartition your computer and install Linux as the operating system, or even in a dual-boot configuration. Instead, you can install Linux in a virtual machine (VM) on your existing computer. This is a safe and easy way to get started with Linux.

These days, it's not even necessary to go through the installation process. Although installing Linux is quite easy and can be a useful learning experience, in order to get started quickly, you can simply download a one of the many available pre-built images.

We will use VirtualBox as the virtualization platform. VirtualBox is a free and open-source desktop virtualization application maintained by Oracle. It is available for Windows, (Intel based) macOS, and Linux and provides a similar experience on all platforms. Before you start, we expect you to have VirtualBox installed on your computer. If you don't have it installed yet, you can download it from the [VirtualBox website](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or install it using a package manager for your operating system.
