`dns` is a fundamental part of every large computer network. `dns` is
used by many network services to translate names into network addresses
and to locate services on the network (by name).

Whenever you visit a web site, send an e-mail, log on to Active
Directory, play Minecraft, chat, or use VoIP, there will be one or
(many) more queries to `dns` services.

Should `dns` fail at your organization, then the whole network will
grind to a halt (unless you hardcoded the network addresses).

You will notice that even the largest of organizations benefit greatly
from having one `dns` infrastructure. Thus `dns` requires all business
units to work together.

Even at home, most home modems and routers have builtin `dns`
functionality.

This module will explain what `dns` actually is and how to set it up
using `Linux` and `bind9`.
