## practice: parameters and options

1\. Write a script that receives four parameters, and outputs them in
reverse order.

2\. Write a script that receives two parameters (two filenames) and
outputs whether those files exist.

3\. Write a script that asks for a filename. Verify existence of the
file, then verify that you own the file, and whether it is writable. If
not, then make it writable.

4\. Make a configuration file for the previous script. Put a logging
switch in the config file, logging means writing detailed output of
everything the script does to a log file in /tmp.
