## practice: parameters and options

1. Write a script that receives four parameters, and outputs them in reverse order.

2. Write a script that receives two parameters (two filenames) and outputs whether those files exist.

3. Write a script that takes a filename as parameter, or asks for a filename if none was given. Verify the existence of the file, then verify that you own the file, and whether it is writable. If not, then make it writable.

4. Make a configuration file for the previous script. Put a logging switch in the config file, logging means writing detailed output of everything the script does to a log file in `/tmp`.
