`This chapter shows a Ubuntu install in Virtualbox. Consider it legacy and use CentOS7 or Debian8 instead (each have their own chapter now).`

This book assumes you have access to a working Linux computer. Most
companies have one or more Linux servers, if you have already logged on
to it, then you 're all set (skip this chapter and go to the next).

Another option is to insert a Ubuntu Linux CD in a computer with (or
without) Microsoft Windows and follow the installation. Ubuntu will
resize (or create) partitions and setup a menu at boot time to choose
Windows or Linux.

If you do not have access to a Linux computer at the moment, and if you
are unable or unsure about installing Linux on your computer, then this
chapter proposes a third option: installing Linux in a virtual machine.

Installation in a virtual machine (provided by `Virtualbox`) is easy and
safe. Even when you make mistakes and crash everything on the virtual
Linux machine, then nothing on the real computer is touched.

This chapter gives easy steps and screenshots to get a working Ubuntu
server in a Virtualbox virtual machine. The steps are very similar to
installing Fedora or CentOS or even Debian, and if you like you can also
use VMWare instead of Virtualbox.
