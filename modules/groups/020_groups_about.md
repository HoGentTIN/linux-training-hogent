Users can be listed in `groups`. Groups allow you to set
permissions on the group level instead of having to set permissions for
every individual user.

Every Unix or Linux distribution will have a graphical tool to manage
groups. Novice users are advised to use this graphical tool. More
experienced users can use command line tools to manage users, but be
careful: Some distributions do not allow the mixed use of GUI and CLI
tools to manage groups (YaST in Novell Suse). Senior administrators can
edit the relevant files directly with `vi` or `vigr`.
