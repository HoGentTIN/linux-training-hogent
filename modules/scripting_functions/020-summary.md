Like in other programming or scripting languages, you can avoid code duplication by defining functions in Bash. However, Bash functions are in multiple ways completely different from functions or methods in other languages. Even the name *function* does not really apply here, as you will see when reading this chapter.

Learning goals:

- Writing a function definition
- Passing arguments to functions
- Understanding return values of a function
- Understanding how the scope of variables defined in a function works
