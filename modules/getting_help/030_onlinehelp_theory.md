# Google

Google is a powerful tool to find help about Unix, or anything else.
Here are some tricks.

Look for phrases instead of single words.

Search only pages from the .be TLD (or substitute .be for any other Top
Level Domain). You can also use \"country:be\" to search only pages from
Belgium (based on ip rather than TLD).

Search for pages inside one domain

Search for pages `not` containing some words.

# Wikipedia

Wikipedia is a web-based, free-content encyclopedia. Its growth over the
past two years has been astonishing. You have a good chance of finding a
clear explanation by typing your search term behind
`http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/` like this example shows.
