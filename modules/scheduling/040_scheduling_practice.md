## practice : scheduling

1\. Schedule two jobs with `at`, display the `at queue` and remove a
job.

2\. As normal user, use `crontab -e` to schedule a script to run every
four minutes.

3\. As root, display the `crontab` file of your normal user.

4\. As the normal user again, remove your `crontab` file.

5\. Take a look at the `cron` files and directories in `/etc` and
understand them. What is the `run-parts` command doing ?
