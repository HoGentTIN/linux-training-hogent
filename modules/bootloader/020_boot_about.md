This chapter briefly discusses the boot sequence of an (Intel 32-bit or
64-bit) Linux computer.

Systems booting with `lilo` are rare nowadays, so this section is brief.

The most common bootloader on Linux systems today is
`grub`, yet this is not a Linux project. Distributions
like `FreeBSD` and `Solaris` also use `grub`.

Likewise, `grub` is not limited to Intel architecture. It can also load
kernels on PowerPC.

Note that `grub`, while still the default in Debian, is slowly being
replaced in most distributions with `grub2`.
