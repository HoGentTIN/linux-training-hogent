## practice: introduction to users

1\. Run a command that displays only your currently logged on user name.

2\. Display a list of all logged on users.

3\. Display a list of all logged on users including the command they are
running at this very moment.

4\. Display your user name and your unique user identification (userid).

5\. Use `su` to switch to another user account (unless you are root, you
will need the password of the other account). And get back to the
previous account.

6\. Now use `su -` to switch to another user and notice the difference.

Note that `su -` gets you into the home directory of `Tania`.

7\. Try to create a new user account (when using your normal user
account). this should fail. (Details on adding user accounts are
explained in the next chapter.)

8\. Now try the same, but with `sudo` before your command.
