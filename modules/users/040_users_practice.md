## practice: introduction to users

1. Run a command that displays only your currently logged on user name.

2. Display a list of all logged on users.

3. Display a list of all logged on users including the command they are
running at this very moment.

4. Display your user name and your unique user identification (userid).

5. Use `su` to switch to another user account (unless you are root, you
will need the password of the other account). And get back to the
previous account.

6. Now use `su -` to switch to another user and notice the difference.

7. Try to create a new user account (when using your normal user account). This should fail. (Details on adding user accounts are explained in the chapter about user management.)

8. Now try the same, but with `sudo` before your command.
