> This book is aimed at novice Linux system administrators (and might be
> interesting and useful for home users that want to know a bit more
> about their Linux system). However, this book is not meant as an
> introduction to Linux desktop applications like text editors,
> browsers, mail clients, multimedia or office applications.
