## practice : basic process management

1\. Use `ps` to search for the `init` process by name.

2\. What is the `process id` of the `init` process ?

3\. Use the `who am i` command to determine your terminal name.

4\. Using your terminal name from above, use `ps` to find all processes
associated with your terminal.

5\. What is the `process id` of your shell ?

6\. What is the `parent process id` of your shell ?

7\. Start two instances of the `sleep 3342` in background.

8\. Locate the `process id` of all `sleep` commands.

9\. Display only those two `sleep` processes in `top`. Then quit top.

10\. Use a `standard kill` to kill one of the `sleep` processes.

11\. Use one command to kill all `sleep` processes.
