## practice: package management on enterprise linux

1. On your Enterprise Linux system, install updates for all available packages. Is there any difference with the Debian way of doing this?

2. Do you always have to reboot your system after installing updates (like you usually have to do on Windows)? When do you have to reboot after updating?

3. Check whether the applications/commands `git`, `scp`, `gcc` and `zork` are installed.

4. Use the package manager to install them. Did you find them all? Did the installation include any dependencies?

5. Search the internet for `webmin` and figure out how to install it.
