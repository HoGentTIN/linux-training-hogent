# practice: interface configuration

1\. Verify whether `dhclient` is running.

2\. Display your current ip address(es).

3\. Display the configuration file where this `ip address` is defined.

4\. Follow the `nic configuration` in the book to change your ip address
from `dhcp client` to `fixed`. Keep the same `ip address` to avoid
conflicts!

5\. Did you also configure the correct `gateway` in the previous
question ? If not, then do this now.

6\. Verify that you have a gateway.

7\. Verify that you can connect to the gateway, that it is alive.

8\. Change the last two digits of your `mac address`.

9\. Which ports are used by http, pop3, ssh, telnet, nntp and ftp ?

10\. Explain why e-mail and websites are sent over `tcp` and not `udp`.

11\. Display the `hostname` of your computer.

12\. Which ip-addresses did your computer recently have contact with ?
