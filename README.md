# Linux Training

The [Linux Training](https://github.com/linuxtraining/lt) series of books by Paul Cobbaut are an excellent free resource and reference for learning Linux. The books are available from <https://linux-training.be> as PDF. However, after publishing a new, but unfinished PDF in 2021, the project seems to have stalled.

At HOGENT, we've been using the Linux Training books for years and we have a vested interest in keeping the contents up-to-date and of high quality. We've been using the PDFs as a basis for our own course materials, and we'd like to be able to contribute back to the project.

The original source format is Docbook XML, and an argument can be made that that's no longer an ideal format. The goal of this repository is to set up a proof of concept to check whether it's possible to convert the Docbook XML to Markdown with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), and then generate a PDF and static HTML site from the Markdown.
