# Linux Fundamentals

By Paul Cobbaut

This book is meant to be used in an instructor-led training. For self-study, the intent is to read this book next to a working Linux computer so you can immediately do every subject, practice each command.

This book is aimed at novice Linux system administrators (and might be interesting and useful for home users that want to know a bit more about their Linux system). However, this book is not meant as an introduction to Linux desktop applications like text editors, browsers, mail clients, multimedia or office applications.

**Please be aware that this website was not built directly by Paul Cobbaut. However, the contents are based on his work.**

The [Linux Training](https://github.com/linuxtraining/lt) series of books by Paul Cobbaut are an excellent free resource and reference for learning Linux. The books are available from <https://linux-training.be> as PDF. However, after publishing a new, but unfinished PDF in 2021, the project seems to have stalled.

At [HOGENT](https://hogent.be), we've been using the Linux Training books for years and we have a vested interest in keeping the contents up-to-date and of high quality. We've been using the PDFs as a basis for our own course materials, and we'd like to be able to contribute back to the project.

The original source format is Docbook XML, and an argument can be made that that's no longer an ideal format. The goal of this repository is to set up a proof of concept to check whether it's possible to convert the Docbook XML to Markdown with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), and then generate a PDF and static HTML site from the Markdown.

What you see right here is a preliminary result of that experiment, created by [Bert Van Vreckem](https://github.com/bertvv/). The procedure is described in [conversion.md](https://github.com/HoGentTIN/linux-training-hogent/blob/main/conversion.md).
