# Linux Fundamentals

Paul Cobbaut, <paul.cobbaut@gmail.com>, <http://www.linkedin.com/in/cobbaut>

This book is meant to be used in an instructor-led training. For self-study, the intent is to read this book next to a working Linux computer so you can immediately do every subject, practice each command.

This book is aimed at novice Linux system administrators (and might be interesting and useful for home users that want to know a bit more about their Linux system). However, this book is not meant as an introduction to Linux desktop applications like text editors, browsers, mail clients, multimedia or office applications.
