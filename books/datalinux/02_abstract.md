# Abstract {.unnumbered}

This book is used as the syllabus for the course "Linux for Data Scientists" for the Bachelor of Applied Computer Science at the HOGENT, Belgium. The contents are based on the [Linux Training](https://linux-training.be) book series by Paul Cobbaut, with updates and additions written by the HOGENT Linux team.

This book is aimed at students specialising in the Data Engineering track that already have some basic knowledge of Linux. Where the sibling "Linux" course for students in Operations/System Administration focuses on Linux as a server operating system, this course rather discusses how Linux can be used as a platform for task and workflow automation.
